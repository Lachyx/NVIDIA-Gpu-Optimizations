# Other:
### Monitor Refresh Rate
Make sure to always check your monitor's refresh rate. You can do that by right-clicking your desktop and clicking Display Settings. Then scroll down to Advanced Display Settings and set the monitor's refresh rate to the highest, and make sure to save it.

### Game Drivers:
Update NVIDIA game drivers in GeForce Experience constantly. Staying up to date with game drivers is always a great thing to do.

### NVIDIA Auto Tuning
Another thing to do that is "risky" is opening your GeForce Experience overlay with ALT + Z and clicking Performance and turning on automatic tuning.

### GPU Scheduling
Turn on Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling in your settings. You can find it under Graphic Settings.

### Turning Off Background Processes
Under Startup Apps in the Windows search bar, turn off any unnecessary apps that could be tanking performance. An example is Razor Synapse. Turning off Game Bar is the best thing you could do. You can do that by searching Game Bar and going to Enable Game Bar and turning that off.

### In-game Settings
If your PC is struggling to run games, it could be due to your settings being too high to handle. Try putting them on low.

### Power Mode Plan
Set your PC's power mode plan to High Performance. Look up how to do that on YouTube.

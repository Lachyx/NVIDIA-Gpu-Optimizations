### Game Drivers:
Update NVIDIA game drivers in GeForce Experience constantly, staying up to date with game drivers is always a great thing to do.

### NVIDIA Auto Tuning
Another thing to do that is `"Risky"` is opening your GeForce experience overlay with `ALT + Z` and clicking `Performance` and turning on automatic tuning

### GPU Scheduling

Turn on Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling in your settings, you can find it under `Graphic Settings`

### Turning Off Background Processes
Under `Startup Apps` in the windows search bar turn off any unnecessary apps that could be tanking performance an example being Razor Synapse, Turning off Game Bar is the best thing that you could do you can do that by searching game bar and going to `Enable Game Bar` and turning that off
